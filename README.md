## Glossary

**virtual machine** is an emulation of a computer system

**usability** is the degree to which the system is easy to use by end-users.
Could include intuitives, number of user errors, useful user feedback and other
metrics.

**tradeoff** is the result of design decisions: implies that there are benefits
and detriments to the design decision and there must be weighed against each other.

**throughput** is the amount of output produced over time.

**testability** is how easy it is to demonstrate errors in the system through
executable tests.

**sychronous**: that in the request/response, this refers to when the client
halts processing until receiving a response from the server.

**asynchronous**: in the request/response, this refers to when the client continous
processing logic after sending a request. The response is dealt with separately.
